## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the application on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alphatechlogics/BiomedicalLiteratureHelperWithBioGPT.git
cd biogpt-biomedical-helper
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Using virtualenv

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Or using Conda

conda create -n biogpt-env python=3.10
conda activate biogpt-env
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have `pip` updated, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download BioGPT Models

The application uses pre-trained BioGPT models from Hugging Face. Ensure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection to download these models.

### 5. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app should automatically open in your default web browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## üöÄ Usage

### üìù Generating Biomedical Text

1. **Select a Pre-trained Model:**

   - Choose from available BioGPT models such as:
     - `microsoft/biogpt`
     - `microsoft/BioGPT-Large`
     - `microsoft/BioGPT-Large-PubMedQA`

2. **Configure Model Parameters:**

- **Minimum Output Length**: Set the minimum number of tokens for the generated text.
- **Maximum Output Length**: Define the maximum number of tokens for the output.
- **Number of Sequences**: Specify how many different text sequences you want BioGPT to generate.

3. **Input Text:**

- Enter the prompt or initial text for which you want BioGPT to generate content. For example:

```bash
Diabetes is
```

4. **Generate Text:**

- Click on the **Generate Tex**t button. The app will process your input and display the generated biomedical text(s) along with the time taken for generation.

5. **Reset Inputs:**

- Use the **Reset** button to clear your inputs and start a new generation session.

### üìö Exploring Examples

- Scroll down to the Examples section to view pre-defined prompts and their generated outputs. This can help you understand how to craft effective prompts for your needs.
